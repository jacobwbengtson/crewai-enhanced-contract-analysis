    This app tests if CrewAI can successfully connect to OpenAI's API by:

    1. Setting up a CrewAI LLM with your API key
    2. Creating a simple agent with that LLM
    3. Creating a basic task for the agent (with expected_output field)
    4. Running the crew with sequential processing
    5. Measuring how long it takes to get a response

    If successful, you'll see the agent's response and timing information.
    If it fails, you'll see detailed error information to help diagnose the issue.

    Note: You no longer need langchain with the latest version of CrewAI, as they've implemented their own LLM interface.
